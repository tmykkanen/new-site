In June 2017, I traveled with the Bethlehem Baptist Church choir to proclaim the name of Jesus in Ireland. I provided pastoral leadership for our team, delivered gospel teachings, and met with Irish church leaders, missionaries, and planters. Thank you to all of you who made this trip possible and fruitful through prayer and financial support!

Read about [ten lessons I learned] (/posts/ireland-trip-reflections).

Read the [Colossians Devotional] (/series/colossians-devotional) I wrote for the trip.

See and hear an [Amazing Grace promo video] (https://www.facebook.com/189344254508763/videos/vb.189344254508763/1311266262316551/?type=2&theater) we made to promote Amazing Grace Country in Buncrana.

Hear recordings of some of the music and see a photo slideshow on [YouTube] (https://youtu.be/zaQSbQBRNaE).

Ireland is a land of remarkable beauty and history. The Irish people are welcoming and warm hearted. Yet, for all the beauty and cultural richness, Ireland is a land of deep suffering. The divide separating the island into two nations is strong. Political and religious identities are difficult to separate, confusing the Irish people about the nature of the true gospel. People who desperately need the healing Jesus brings want nothing to do with the church.

Ireland needs churches that clearly proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ while winsomely engaging the complex culture. One way to meet the deep spiritual needs in Ireland is through the work of church planting.

Church planting is one of the most strategic means God uses to proclaim his gospel among all nations. Pastor Tim Keller writes, “The vigorous, continual planting of new congregations is the single most crucial strategy for 1) the numerical growth of the body of Christ in any city, and 2) the continual corporate renewal and revival of the existing churches in a city.”

Our prayer is that this trip will bear near and long-term fruit for Jesus’s glory in Ireland. Near-term, we pray local believers were encouraged through the gifts of music and the Word and unbelievers were challenged with the message of the gospel. Long-term, we hope to build gospel partnerships for church planting efforts.

For the sake of the name of Jesus,

Tyler Mykkanen
